<h1> Project Name </h1>

This event invitation is a mockup of a engagement invitation page that uses 
<ul>
<li>Bootstrap</li>
<li>jQuery</li>
<li>SCSS compiler</li>
<li>HTML</li>
<li>CSS</li>
<br>
It aims to use a minimalistic approach to present the information for prospective guests and family members to this event. The parallax theme also makes it easy for guests to see all the information they need on a single page.
